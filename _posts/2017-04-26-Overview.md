* * [oriented] Berge-Fulkerson conjecture
* * 5-flow conjecture
* * (m,n)-cycle covers
* * Bouchet's 6-flow conjecture
* * unit vector flows conjectures
* * three 4-flows conjecture and variations
* * Petersen colouring conjecture
* * modified 2 bipartizing matchings conjecture
* [graceful labeling (conjecture)](https://github.com/gexahedron/graceful-labeling) - including:
* * harmonious labeling (conjecture)
* * sequential labeling (conjecture)
* * edge-graceful labeling (conjecture)
* [Graham-HÃ¤ggkvist conjecture](https://github.com/gexahedron/graham-haggkvist-conjecture) - including:
* * directed graph variation (with anti-directed trees)
